# FoodOrder
FoodOrder Page - First Try - Done in MVC and making use of Entity FrameWork

# Technical Points

I had no Prior knowledge of MVC, no prior knowledge of entity framework.

Entity Framework normally by default works with Sql Server, I configered it to run with Mysql after much research :).

This was a fun project to see if I could get the hang of using MVC and Entity Framework, as I'm always looking to improve myself, 
I'm intermediate programmer after all :).

This project is no-where near production level, but this was more about what I was able to accomplish with knowledge aquired over two days.
